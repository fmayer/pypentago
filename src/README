pypentago is an implementation of the Pentago board game in Python.
It is written by Florian Mayer(flormayer [AT-SIGN] aim {DOT} com).

This version is in a really early state and only supports local games.
Nevertheless, parts of the server have been implemented and you are asked
to run all the unittests to test the functionality of pypentago on your
platform. Run unittests/main.py to do so.

To run the game, execute pypentago/client/main.py.
