pypentago is an implementation of the Pentago board game in Python.
It is written by Florian Mayer(flormayer [AT-SIGN] aim {DOT} com).

Please run the testsuite to test pypentago on your platform.
Run unittests/main.py to do so.

To run the game, execute pypentago/client/main.py.

INSTALLATION
The installation file depends on setuptools, so you should install that
first.
pypentago depends on twisted and PyQt4, so you will need to install those
before installing pypentago. Please note that on Windows operating systems
twisted depends on pywin32, so you will need that as well.

On Unix systems, run 'python setup.py install' with root rights (either as
root or with sudo). This will place pypentago and pypentagod in your
/usr/bin. Run pypentagod to start the server and pypentago to run the
client.

With Windows, the best way is to use the installer. This should place
pypentago.exe and pypentagod.exe in [your python directory]\Scripts (e.g.
C:\Python26\Scripts). Use those to run the client or the server,
respectively.
