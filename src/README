pypentago is an implementation of the Pentago board game in Python.
It is written by Florian Mayer(flormayer [AT-SIGN] aim {DOT} com).

Please run the testsuite to test pypentago on your platform.
Run unittests/main.py to do so.

INSTALLATION
The installation file depends on setuptools, so you should install that
first.
pypentago depends on twisted and PyQt4, so you will need to install those
before installing pypentago.

On Unix systems, run 'python setup.py install' with root rights (either as
root or with sudo). This will place pypentago and pypentagod in your
/usr/bin. Run pypentagod to start the server and pypentago to run the
client.
